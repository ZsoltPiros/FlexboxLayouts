Copy the layouts from the pictures.
Each layout should be separate, and after you done with each layout should commit and push to github.

After you done with the layouts, make a custom FORM, with the layout of your choosing, it should use
the different css properties like: display:felx, position: absolute/relative/etc... You could look at
websites of your choosing, how a form is made, what are the questions etc.

Questions:
Please do not copy paste, answer in english and with your own words.

1. What does exactly position: absolute; do to an HTML element?

	-If another element like a container has a relative value, the absolute valued element will move in it's range. It moves in relation to it's "parent" element.
		Without a "parent" element it sees the website as a parents so it moves within it's range.

2. What is position relative?

	-We can use positioning like top, bottom, left, right. We just positioning it without moving any other things.

3. What does box-sizing: border-box do to your HTML? why is it useful?


	-We can add the "box's" width, height, padding etc.
		It is useful because we can customize it as we want.


PS: You are passing the exam only above 80%, which means you will have to retake it, which is extra work for me and also for you.
